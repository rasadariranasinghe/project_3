# Data Visualization of Crime Patterns in Toronto During the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Overview
This project explores the patterns and trends in criminal activities in Toronto during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in the daily lives of Canadians, including business closures, canceled events, and stay-at-home orders. This project explores how these changes impacted crime patterns in Toronto by analyzing data from 2014 to 2022. By visualizing trends in crime rates and types before, during, and after the pandemic, the project aims to identify significant shifts potentially linked to the pandemic's effects on the city.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on cities worldwide, including Toronto. This project aims to visualize the changes in crime patterns during this period, providing insights into how the pandemic might have influenced criminal behavior.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: The data was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or irrelevant information.
- **Analysis**: Statistical analysis was performed to identify trends and correlations.
- **Visualization**: Various data visualization techniques were employed to represent the findings clearly.

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations such as:
- Time series plots illustrating the changes in crime rates over time.
- Bar charts comparing the types of crimes before and during the pandemic.

## Results
The results indicate that certain types of crimes, such as domestic violence, increased during the pandemic, while others, such as theft, decreased due to lockdown measures.

## Conclusions
The findings suggest that the pandemic had a mixed impact on crime in Toronto. These visualizations can be useful for policymakers and law enforcement in understanding and addressing the underlying causes.
